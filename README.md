This repository contains the python scripts used in the research project presented in Chapter 5 of the TU Delft PhD thesis titled "Advanced Magnetocaloric Regenerators for Heat Pump Applications". The aim of the research project was to determine
the flow and heat transfer characteristics of a new geometry used for active magnetocaloric regenerators. The geometry results from an extrusion-based additive manufacturing process whereby layers of parallel fibers are printed
with controlled spacing between them, with each successive layer oriented at an alternating angle to create a porous block structure. A description of the contents of this repository is given in what follows.
